## Description 
A candidate search application that integrates with the GitHub API to display candidate profiles, allowing users to review, save, or reject candidates.

- Implemented save and reject functionality, storing accepted candidates locally and enabling persistent storage using local storage.
- Designed the UI for easy navigation, including an option to view and manage a list of saved candidates.
- Deployed the application to Render with environment variables securely configured.
